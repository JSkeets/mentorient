# Mentorient
a web applicataion for landlords to manage tenants, properties, and parts. 

# About
this project is very new and is great for first time or long time contributors. The application is running on a subdomain of azurewebsites.net until we get an application that is usable. Right now, there is some functionality but a lot of work lef todo. 
When the community sees fit (the community is you and I) then I will go ahead  and route the main domain name to the application so that consumers can start using the application.
